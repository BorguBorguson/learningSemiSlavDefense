Today I've been studying the Semi-Slav Defense; it's a defense where Black forms a triangular set of pawns on d5, c6, and e6 to oppose White's pawns on d4 and c4.

The triangle variation establishes these pawns before developing the Black King's Knight, such that if the game has proceeded:

*1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c6*

and White plays *4. Nf3*, Black may play *4. ... dxc4*.
