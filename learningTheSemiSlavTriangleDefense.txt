Today I've been studying the Semi-Slav Defense; it's a defense where Black forms a triangular set of pawns on d5, c6, and e6 to oppose White's pawns on d4 and c4.

The triangle variation establishes these pawns before developing the Black King's Knight, such that if the game has proceeded:

*1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 c6*

and White plays *4. Nf3*, Black may play *4. ... dxc4*. 

In response, White will try to develop and exert control of the center, by *5. e3*.

Black now plays the logical *5. ...b5*, supporting the pawn on c4.  Note that the move *2. ...c6* earlier supports this pawn on *b5* against White's Knight on c3.

White now needs to break this formation apart, and vigorously.  This is best done by *6. a4*, threatening axb5, with the Knight's support.


Some local changes.
